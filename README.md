# Drone-Strike-Analysis

Between 2010 and 2020 the Bureau of Investigative Journalism collected data on US strikes in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Somalia and Yemen from government, military and intelligence officials, and from credible media, academic and other sources, including Bureau researchers. Here in the data set, the Bureau presents quantitative data on strikes and casualty estimates in spreadsheets, and qualitative data in narrative timelines.

This analysis is based upon the statistics the Bureau have documented at this present time. The data has been filtered to confirmed drone strikes or possible drone strikes, it includes other kinds of military air strikes but the focus is on drone strikes.
